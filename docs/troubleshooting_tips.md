## Electrostatic Discharge
The mosaic-G5 P3 GNSS receiver is sensitive to [ESD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge "Electrostatic Discharge"). Use a proper grounding system to make sure that the working surface and the components are at the same electric potential.

!!! warning "ESD Precaution"
	As recommended by the manufacturer, we highly recommend that users take the necessary precautions to avoid damaging their GNSS receiver.

	-   - The All-band GNSS RTK breakout board features ESD protection on the USB-C connector and breakout's I/O:

			- USB data lines
			- I/O PTH pads
			- JST connector and BlueSMiRF header pins
		- The mosaic-G5 P3 GNSS receiver features internal ESD protection to the `ANT_1` antenna input.

## GNSS Antenna

### Power Input
!!! danger "Active Antenna"
	Never inject an external DC voltage into the SMA connector for the GNSS antenna, as it may damage the mosaic-G5 P3 GNSS receiver. For instance, when using a splitter to distribute the antenna signal to several GNSS receivers, make sure that no more than one output of the splitter passes DC. Use [DC-blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_block) otherwise.



### Supported Frequency Bands
For the best performance, we recommend users choose a compatible L1/L2/L5/L6 GNSS antenna and utilize a low-loss cable. Utilizing an antenna that doesn't match all the supported frequency bands of the mosaic-G5 P3, will result in reduced performance and capabilities.
